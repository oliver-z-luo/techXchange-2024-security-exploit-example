### **Widgetify Integration Knowledge Base**

### **1. Introduction to Widgetify API Integration**

The **Widgetify** API allows SaaS products to seamlessly integrate widgets into their platform, offering real-time data visualization, user interactivity, and custom widget creation. Integrating the API involves configuring authentication, setting up the API endpoint, and managing real-time data streams.

### **2. Getting Started with Widgetify API**

#### **Authentication Setup**
To interact with the Widgetify API, your system must authenticate using OAuth 2.0. Below are the steps to authenticate and acquire an access token:

1. **Request Access Token**:
   - Endpoint: `POST /oauth/token`
   - Example request:
     ```bash
     curl -X POST https://api.widgetify.com/oauth/token \
     -d "client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID" \
     -d "client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET" \
     -d "grant_type=client_credentials"
     ```

2. **Access Token Usage**:
   Once you receive the token, include it in the header for all API requests:
   ```bash
   Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
   ```

### **3. Key Endpoints for Widgetify API**

#### **Fetching Widget Data**
To retrieve widget data, make a `GET` request to the following endpoint:
```bash
GET /widgets/{widget_id}
```
- **Parameters**:
  - `widget_id`: The ID of the widget you want to fetch.
  - `filters`: Optional filters to customize the data returned.

Example Response:
```json
{
  "widget_id": "abc123",
  "widget_name": "Sales Dashboard",
  "data": {...}
}
```

#### **Creating Custom Widgets**
To create a new widget, send a `POST` request:
```bash
POST /widgets
```
- **Body**:
  - `widget_name`: The name of the new widget.
  - `configuration`: JSON object containing widget settings.

### **4. Troubleshooting Common Issues**

#### **1. Invalid Access Token**
If you receive an invalid token error (`401 Unauthorized`), ensure that:
- Your token hasn’t expired.
- The `Authorization` header is correctly formatted with the bearer token.

**Solution**:
- Re-authenticate by following the OAuth process and updating your token.

#### **2. Rate Limit Exceeded**
The Widgetify API imposes rate limits to prevent abuse. If you exceed these limits, you will receive a `429 Too Many Requests` error.

**Solution**:
- Implement exponential backoff in your API calls to handle rate limits.

#### **3. Widget Not Displaying Correct Data**
If your widget isn’t displaying data as expected, double-check the filters and data stream settings. Incorrect filters may lead to incomplete data.

### **5. Best Practices for Using the Widgetify API**

1. **Optimize API Calls**:
   - Minimize the number of API calls by using pagination and data caching where possible.

2. **Monitor API Usage**:
   - Use the Widgetify dashboard to monitor your API usage and avoid hitting rate limits.

3. **Security Considerations**:
   - Ensure that all API requests are made over HTTPS.
   - Regularly rotate access tokens to reduce the risk of compromised credentials.

### **6. FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions**

#### **Q1: How can I reset my API credentials?**
Navigate to the Widgetify dashboard, and under the **API Settings** section, you can generate new API credentials and invalidate old ones.

#### **Q2: How do I add a custom widget to my SaaS product?**
Use the `/widgets` endpoint to create a new widget and integrate it into your platform using the provided widget ID.

#### **Q3: What’s the maximum data size for widget configurations?**
The Widgetify API allows up to 1MB of data for widget configurations. For larger data sets, use data compression or make multiple API requests.
